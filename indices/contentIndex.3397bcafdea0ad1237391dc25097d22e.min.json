I love the way the site currently is and I may keep using v3 going forward and modify it myself as I go\n\nFeel free to check out [[notes/about-using-quartz|Why Use Quartz?]].\n\nFor the comments section, I'm taking advantage of [giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus). It uses the Discussions feature of this site's repository, as the site's comments system. This is very helpful since the site itself is hosted by GitHub Pages so we don't have to use another provider.\n\nThe site is not yet finished, but it will eventually be.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T16:54:09.863672834Z","tags":["site"]},"/blog/2023-07-31":{"title":"ðŸŽ‰ v1.1 is up","content":"\nContinuing my work to make the site more functional and have everything come all together, this new release should fix issues with Giscus. Note that SPA is disabled temporarily to fix the comments not loading. Additionally, the site looks different now! I just changed the colors so that the website looks a little more like my own garden.\n\nAnother new thing I've learned is that you can have separate folders for the notes. Right now, all blogs go to the `content/blog` folder. This is an important step because I may change some stuff later to make Hugo display the latest blog entries in the index page. For now, everything is in [[blog]] and [[notes]].\n\nI also added a new feature that can be used in the page's frontmatter `enableComments`. This value is always assumed to be true, but you can disable it using `enableComments: false`. This way, the comment section will not be displayed. You can see this in action using [[notes/comments-disabled]].\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T16:54:09.863672834Z","tags":["site"]},"/notes/about-using-quartz":{"title":"Why Use Quartz?","content":"\nI wanted to use Quartz because I wanted a simple and elegant website where I can make my own website garden. I want to share lots of information without all the visual clutter, where everything is easily navigatable, modifiable, and feedback-able thanks to the tools that Quartz and Hugo give at our disposal. Quartz boasts the following:\n\n- Full-text search - Search any note by title or body text\n- Wikilinks - Notes are easily transferrable with working links\n- Backlinks - Bidirectional linking from page to page\n- Local graph - Graph view located at the bottom\n- Tags - Group related notes by their assigned tags\n- Link previews - Preview the note by hovering\n\nThese features come out-of-the-box in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the app I use as my \"second brain.\" Quartz integrates those features to seamlessly make a page without any fuss. Now, it would've been helpful when [Dataview exporting](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/projects/6) will be a thing. It would really help in making MOCs.\n\nIf you want to know more, check out [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T16:54:09.863672834Z","tags":["site"]},"/notes/comments-disabled":{"title":"Note with disabled comments","content":"\nThis note should have comments disabled.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T16:54:09.863672834Z","tags":[]}}
