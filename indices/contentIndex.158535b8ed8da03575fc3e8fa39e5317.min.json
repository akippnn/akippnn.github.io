Note that SPA is disabled temporarily to fix the comments not loading. Additionally, the site looks different now! I just changed the colors so that the website looks a little more like my own garden.\n\nAnother new thing I've learned is that you can have separate folders for the notes. Right now, all blogs go to the `content/blog` folder. ~~This is an important step because I may change some stuff later to make Hugo display the latest blog entries in the index page.~~ This feature has been added, check out [[index]] to see all the new blog posts.\n\nI also added a new feature that can be used in the page's frontmatter `enableComments`. This value is always assumed to be true, but you can disable it using `enableComments: false`. This way, the comment section will not be displayed. You can see this in action using [[notes/comments-disabled]].\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-07T10:39:40.538920044Z","tags":["site"]},"/blog/2023-09-06":{"title":"ðŸŽ‰ Finally, aurutilsinstaller got an update!","content":"## \"Final\"\n\nThis is the milestone of this small project, what's left is to finish the scripts, and then I can finally focus on my other projects. You can see the new update live at the [`final` branch](https://github.com/akippnn/aurutilsinstaller/tree/final), but the branch will be eventually merged to main.\n\nThis change removes the original monolithic single script altogether, and starts by reading every `.sh` file inside the `scripts` folder. Previously, the script was more a side project than anything - the most time I spent on was the README itself (and at the time, I believed I had better things to do besides learning bash scripting). But there was a real need to separate all the scripts into their own files.\n\nI was only active recently in Arch Linux (school being the primary thing that took most of my time) to make the needed changes. Now that the project itself is modular, it will be much easier to make changes and add new scripts and their interface for different purposes.\n\n### Originally a script for beginners\n\nI never really thought of using a TUI until now, and so I used one specifically made for shell scripts. There are a lot to choose from, one example is `gum` and another is `FTXUI`. There are some thoughts to use C++ and CMake/Conan going forward, the only problem is that I don't have the . I used `dialog` because it is in the `core` repository.\n\nWe already had a form of TUI with `select`, but it's a nightmare to navigate, and even more of a nightmare to code. It would simply be an overhead.\n\nDuring the development of the script last year, since the change of intentions to make this more friendly towards intermediate users, I wanted to add arg parsing to simplify the installation process with a command that can be saved and copy-pasted. Now that the project is modular, I could even add Zenity on top of the already-existing TUI, without having to change the main script.\n\nAnother thing I've learned of is the existence of git submodules, which will actually give another option for those that want to compile all the dependencies on their own in an environment where internet connection is a problem. I believe it is safe unless it is used in an outdated system, or the local copy of the submodules is old.\n\n### Not just a small project\n\nThis is more than a small project to me. It is my progress as a programmer. It's not the size of the project that mattered, it's small things that make up the whole discipline for me. Adopting the best practices, finding ways to improve my workflow, looking for alternatives that simplifies the entire process.\n\nThere's so much for all of us to learn, there's no end goal but learning new things, adapting to them, and immortalizing them...I think this is my own means to live.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-07T10:39:40.538920044Z","tags":["projects/aurutilsinstaller"]},"/notes/about-using-quartz":{"title":"Why Use Quartz?","content":"\nI wanted to use Quartz because I wanted a simple and elegant website where I can make my own website garden. I want to share lots of information without all the visual clutter, where everything is easily navigatable, modifiable, and feedback-able thanks to the tools that Quartz and Hugo give at our disposal. Quartz boasts the following:\n\n- Full-text search - Search any note by title or body text\n- Wikilinks - Notes are easily transferrable with working links\n- Backlinks - Bidirectional linking from page to page\n- Local graph - Graph view located at the bottom\n- Tags - Group related notes by their assigned tags\n- Link previews - Preview the note by hovering\n\nThese features come out-of-the-box in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the app I use as my \"second brain.\" Quartz integrates those features to seamlessly make a page without any fuss. Now, it would've been helpful when [Dataview exporting](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/projects/6) will be a thing. It would really help in making MOCs.\n\nIf you want to know more, check out [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-07T10:39:40.538920044Z","tags":["site"]},"/notes/comments-disabled":{"title":"Note with disabled comments","content":"\nThis note should have comments disabled.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-07T10:39:40.538920044Z","tags":[]}}
