There's quite a lot to unpack here.

This site release uses [Quartz v3.3](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/releases/tag/v3.3). I love the way the site currently is and I may keep using v3 going forward and modify it myself as I go

Feel free to check out [[notes/about-using-quartz|Why Use Quartz?]].

For the comments section, I'm taking advantage of [giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus). It uses the Discussions feature of this site's repository, as the site's comments system. This is very helpful since the site itself is hosted by GitHub Pages so we don't have to use another provider.

The site is not yet finished, but it will eventually be.
