Continuing my work to make the site more functional and have everything come all together, this new release should fix issues with Giscus. Note that SPA is disabled temporarily to fix the comments not loading. Additionally, the site looks different now! I just changed the colors so that the website looks a little more like my own garden.

Another new thing I've learned is that you can have separate folders for the notes. Right now, all blogs go to the `content/blog` folder. ~~This is an important step because I may change some stuff later to make Hugo display the latest blog entries in the index page.~~ This feature has been added, check out [[index]] to see all the new blog posts.

I also added a new feature that can be used in the page's frontmatter `enableComments`. This value is always assumed to be true, but you can disable it using `enableComments: false`. This way, the comment section will not be displayed. You can see this in action using [[notes/comments-disabled]].
