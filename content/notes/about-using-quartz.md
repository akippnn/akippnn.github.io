I wanted to use Quartz because I wanted a simple and elegant website where I can make my own website garden. I want to share lots of information without all the visual clutter, where everything is easily navigatable thanks to the navigation tools that Quartz gives at our disposal:

- Backlinking (a.k.a. Bidirectional linking)
- Powerful [[notes/search]].
- Graph View
- Tags

These features come out-of-the-box in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the app I use as my "second brain." Quartz integrates those features to seamlessly make a page without any fuss. Now, if only [Dataview exporting](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/projects/6) was a thing during the writing of this article.
