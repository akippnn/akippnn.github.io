title: Why Use Quartz?

I wanted to use Quartz because I wanted a simple and elegant website where I can make my own website garden. I want to share lots of information without all the visual clutter, where everything is easily navigatable, modifiable, and feedback-able thanks to the tools that Quartz and Hugo give at our disposal. Quartz boasts the following:

- Full-text search - Search any note by title or body text
- Wikilinks - Notes are easily transferrable with working links
- Backlinks - Bidirectional linking from page to page
- Local graph - Graph view located at the bottom
- Tags - Group related notes by their assigned tags
- Link previews - Preview the note by hovering

These features come out-of-the-box in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the app I use as my "second brain." Quartz integrates those features to seamlessly make a page without any fuss. Now, it would've been helpful when [Dataview exporting](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/projects/6) will be a thing. It would really help in making MOCs.
