There's quite a lot to unpack here.

This site is currently using [Quartz v3.3](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/releases/tag/v3.3). It's possible I may move to using [Flowershow (official website)](https://flowershow.app/) as time goes on.

Feel free to check out [[notes/about-using-quartz]].

For the comments section, I'm taking advantage of [giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus). It uses the Discussions feature of this site's repository, as the site's comments system. This is very helpful since the site itself is hosted by GitHub Pages so we don't have to use another provider.

The site is not yet finished, but it will eventually be.
