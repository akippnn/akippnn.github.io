It uses the Discussions feature of this site's repository, as the site's comments system. This is very helpful since the site itself is hosted by GitHub Pages so we don't have to use another provider.\r\n\r\nThe site is not yet finished, but it will eventually be.\r\n",

    "content": "\r\n\r\nI wanted to use Quartz because I wanted a simple and elegant website where I can make my own website garden. I want to share lots of information without all the visual clutter, where everything is easily navigatable thanks to the navigation tools that Quartz gives at our disposal:\r\n\r\n- Backlinking (a.k.a. Bidirectional linking)\r\n- Powerful [[notes/search]].\r\n- Graph View\r\n- Tags\r\n\r\nThese features come out-of-the-box in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the app I use as my \"second brain.\" Quartz integrates those features to seamlessly make a page without any fuss. Now, if only [Dataview exporting](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/projects/6) was a thing during the writing of this article.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more, check out [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).\r\n",

    "title": "Search",
    "content": "\r\nFrom \u003chttps://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/search\u003e.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\r\n\r\n## Full-text\r\n\r\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\r\n\r\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\r\n# the default option\r\nenableSemanticSearch: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Natural Language\r\n\r\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\r\n\r\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\r\n\r\nHere's how to set it up.\r\n\r\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\r\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\r\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\r\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty.\r\n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\r\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\r\n\r\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\r\n# the default option\r\nsearch:\r\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\r\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\r\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\r\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index. Enjoy natural language search powered by Operand!\r\n",
